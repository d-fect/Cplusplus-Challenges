# Cplusplus-Challenges
A place where I collect my programming challenges and solutions to learn C++ better.

When I do these challenges I will stream it on [Twitch.tv](https://www.twitch.tv/oldgrumpygamer). Please join me there and give me constructive input.

## Current ideas
* Doing the starting challenges from the sites listed below
* Bubble sort
* Quick sort

## Websites with challenges
I will check out the sites listed below to find more challenges

### [Sphere Online Judge](https://www.spoj.com/)
These guys have 6573 public problems.
You write your program and submit it on the site and then the site automatically tests your program and checks if it works.

### [Rosetta Code](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:Programming_Tasks)
This site has 881 current tasks, so I think I will have enough for a while.
They don't test your solution, but provides solutions in hundreds of languages
